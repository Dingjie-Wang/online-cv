    title: Basic Information
    summary: |
      I am a Tenure-track Associate Professor and Researcher in Institute for Math & AI, Wuhan University.
      I obtained Ph.D. (2019) in Computational Mathematics from School of Mathematics and Statistics, Wuhan University, supervised by 
      [Prof. Xiufen Zou.](http://jszy.whu.edu.cn/zouxiufen/zh_CN/index.htm)
      During graduate stage, I used to be a visiting scholar in Department of Internal Medicine, University of Iowa (2017-2018) and Department of Biomedical Informatics,
      The Ohio State University (2018-2019), respectively. After graduation, I started my postdoc at The Ohio State University and University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 
      under the supervision of [Prof. Kin Fai Au](http://augroup.org/), from 2019 to 2024. Prior to joining Wuhan University, 
      I am a Research Fellow in Department of Applied Mathematics at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. 
      Currently, I serve as a Youth Editorial Board Member for [iMeta (2025 IF = 33.2)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/2770596x) 
      and [Genomics, Proteomics and Bioinformatics](https://academic.oup.com/gpb), 
      and as a reviewer for several international journals, including Nature Biotechnology, Genome Biology, Bioinformatics, and Artificial Intelligence Review.

      I am actively seeking highly motivated [Postdoc](https://rsb.whu.edu.cn/info/1182/29601.htm), 
      [PhD](https://maths.whu.edu.cn/info/4842/142072.htm) and [Master](https://gs.whu.edu.cn/info/1062/105721.htm) students from Mathematic, Statistic, Computer Science, Bioinformatics, or similar fields.

    title: Research Interests
    summary: |      
      I am primarily engaged in interdisciplinary research involving mathematics,
      machine learning, and biomedical sciences. My research encompasses areas
      such as bioinformatics, computational systems biology, and the theory and
      application of tensor decomposition. Currently, my primary research interest
      lies in developing innovative algorithms and statistical models to perform
      reliable quantitative and function analyses of gene isoforms and
      Transposable Elements (TEs) using cutting-edge sequencing techniques from
      PacBio and Oxford Nanopore Technologies. Our studies are anticipated to provide
      an efficient bioinformatics platform for improve our understanding of gene isoforms
      and TEs with complex biomedical context in a comprehensive manner. The specific topics I have examined include:
        - Develop statistical models for identifying and quantifying gene isoforms and TEs.
        - Design long-read-based pipeline to reveal landscape of zygotic TE activation during early embryogenesis in zebrafish.
        - Construction of gene/isoform regulatory networks using diverse genomic data.
        - Design network-based computational framework to predict and differentiate functions among gene isoforms. 
        - Develop tensor-based indicators to identify key components in complex gene/isoform regulatory networks.
